Generators are iterators, but you can only iterate over them once.


                   It’s because they do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly. You use them by iterating over them, either with a ‘for’ loop or by passing them to any function or construct that iterates.


                                             Most of the time generators are implemented as functions.

                     However, they do not return a value, they yield it.
